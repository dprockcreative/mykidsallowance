						<p>
							I built this site for my own children...
							to help give them an appreciation of <strong>money</strong>, the beginnings of a <strong>work ethic</strong> and hopefully a sense of what parents go through to provide for them.
						</p>

						<p>
							Perhaps growing into the working world won&rsquo;t be such a shock. 
							But additionally I want to help them develop values for <strong>Saving</strong> &amp; <strong>Charity</strong>.
						</p>

						<p>
							My Allowance&rsquo; Settings include options for Taxes, Savings &amp; Charitable Contributions  as well as Advances, Bonuses &amp; Docking for those important, exceptional or difficult times.
