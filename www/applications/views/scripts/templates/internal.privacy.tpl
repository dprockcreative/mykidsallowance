<h4>An overview of the information that <?= $this->config->site->default->name->full; ?> may collect</h4>
<p>
	You are able to take advantage of many <?= $this->config->site->default->name->full; ?> products, services, and websites without providing any information that personally identifies you. We only collect personally-identifying information when you voluntarily submit it to us.
</p>
<p>
	You may choose not to provide us with any personally-identifying information. In that case, you can still access and use many portions of this website; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of any <?= $this->config->site->default->name->full; ?> website that require your personal information.
</p>
<p>
	This website may include community features, such as online forums and message boards. Information that is posted in these areas becomes public information and the use that any third party makes of this information is beyond our ability to control. You should exercise caution before disclosing any personally-identifying information in these public venues. If you elect to submit content that includes information that can be used to identify you, you must assume that the content can and will be displayed on any website on the Internet.
</p>
<p>
	In some circumstances, we also collect non-personally-identifying information. When you visit a this website, we may collect information such as the type of browser you use, your operating system, your IP address, and the domain name of your Internet Service Provider. This information, by itself, does not permit individual identification, meaning that you will remain anonymous. However, if you elect to provide us with personally-identifying information during your visit, that information may be linked to your IP address.
</p>
<p>
	When you visit this website, we may send one or more cookies -- small, removable data files -- to your computer. We use cookies to uniquely identify your browser, which allows us to enhance and personalize your online experience at this website. For example, cookies allow us to recognize you when you return to a website and present relevant content to you when you visit. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to warn you when cookies are sent, or to refuse all cookies. Some of the features and services of this website may not operate properly if your cookies are disabled. Cookies, by themselves, do not provide us with any personally-identifying information.
</p>
<p>
	Some portions of this website may contain links to other sites. By clicking on these links, you will leave the website operated by <?= $this->config->site->default->name->full; ?> and this Privacy Policy will no longer apply. These other site&rsquo;s information practices may be different than ours. You should consult the other site&rsquo;s privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.
