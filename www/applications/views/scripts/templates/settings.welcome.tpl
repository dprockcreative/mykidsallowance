					Settings are re-useable sets of preferences that you build yourself to customize how your kids allowances will be affected.
				</p>
		
				<p class="content">
					The only further requirement for Settings is that at least one must be of <em>type &ldquo;<strong>Base</strong>&rdquo;</em>. This will be analogous to Base Pay in your own wages. 
				</p>
		
				<p class="content">
					They are Re-Useable in the sense that for each of your Kid&rsquo;s Allowances, you will assign one or more of these Settings and give it a value for that kid.

				<h5>For instance:</h5>
				<ol>
					<li>You create a Setting called &ldquo;My Kids Allowance&rdquo; and assigning it type &ldquo;Base&ldquo;</li>
					<li>Now you are able to create Allowances.</li> 
					<li>You make one for John (7 years old) with a &ldquo;My Kids Allowance&rdquo; preference of $10.00 to be applied Weekly.</li>
					<li>Then you set up one for Mary (5 years old). You won&rsquo;t need to create another set of Settings for her. Just re-use the &ldquo;My Kids Allowance&rdquo; but give it a different amount appropriate for her age.</li>
